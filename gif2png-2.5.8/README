		gif2png -- GIF to PNG graphics file conversion

The gif2png program converts files from the Graphic Interchange Format
to Portable Network Graphics.  It can be built under any Unix, or
under MS-DOS or Windows using djgpp, or using Borland C. I don't know
when the djgpp or Borland builds were last tested.

This distribution also supplies web2png, a Python front end for
gif2png which automagically converts entire web hierarchies (the
graphics files themselves and references to them in web pages).

You can test the correctness of this code with the regression-test
suite in the directory test/. While gif2png is very mature and
well-tested, the kinds of bit-level tweaking operations it does could
go subtly wrong on unusual hardware architectures.

These programs have a home site at <http://www.catb.org/~esr/gif2png/>.
